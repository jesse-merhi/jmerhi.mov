origin = scheme + host + port
Site http://www.example.com:80 https://api.example.com:443
site = private_domain + public_suffix
scheme, subdomain and port SOP (Same Origin Policy) Blocks resource requests to/from an external site
&amp;ldquo;External&amp;rdquo; is based on SOP: only requests from the same origin are allowed to use the resources

All of the challenges from this week forward ARE REALLY VALUABLE Reports Reports are really cool! They tell you, How you found a vulnerability. How bad it is. How to fix it. You will be doing this TWICE.</description></item><item><title>03: iam 2</title><link>/week3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/week3/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ll get started at 5 past!

Basically how you can find stuff in a database. Some examples of &amp;ldquo;Flavours&amp;rdquo; (different implementations of SQL) include SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL Server Databases
Tables Defined through columns Contain records each record potentially containing a value for every cell.

Reports (general feedback) Consider context when determining impact, not everything is critical. Keep technical stuff out of impact/remediation. It should mostly be in steps to reproduce.

DevSecOps Waterfall &amp;#x1f30a; vs agile &amp;#x1f3c3; Systematic/design vulnerabilities are much harder to solve than simple coding/logic errors.
This is exacerbated in the waterfall approach, as you don&amp;rsquo;t really go back to the design phase.
Waterfall &amp;#x1f30a; exponentially more $$$ to fix bugs later into SDLC we want to shift security left &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;#x1f4bb; vms vs containers &amp;#x1f433; CVEs</description></item><item><title>10: advanced stuff</title><link>/week10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/week10/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ll get started at 18:05 Week10 COMP6443 H18A Final exam Overview wednesday, 3rd May 3 hours (1pm - 4pm) worth 50% whats in it everything is assessableâ„¢ not just stuff from wargames submit a short writeup explaination there&amp;rsquo;s also a shortish devsecops question how2hack my biggest tip is try not to stress out + practice, practice, practice start with recon before you write payloads CI/CD keeping it secure github actions (ramble) pre-commit hooks .</description></item><item><title>extended08</title><link>/extended8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/extended8/</guid><description>Java deserialization slides are available https://waugh.zip/6443/extended08/
Bypassing CSP Self What is &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;? who am I?, why am I here? can things only be loaded from localhost? Let&amp;rsquo;s consult the experts &amp;ldquo;The self keyword in a Content-Security-Policy header directive, &amp;hellip; is an alias for the same origin.&amp;rdquo; from https://content-security-policy.com/self/
